    "<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2><br>\n",
    "For the past few decades, the \"tech dinosaurs\" in the United States have been engaging in aggressive acquisitions of emerging businesses as a means of expanding their dominant power in the tech industry. Some acquisitions have faciliated the big-tech enterprises to extend their business power over emerging indsutries, while others have also impeded the growth of the business as a liability. <br><br>\n",
    "Throughout this project, my goal is to look into the instances of success and failure in company acquisition of the big-tech enterprises, and determine how it reveals the business strategies that these enterprises have taken in the past few decades. <br><br>\n",
    "Note: The 7 big-tech enterprises that I will be examining include:<br>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "    Apple<br>Facebook<br>Google<br>IBM<br>Microsoft<br>Twitter<br>Yahoo\n",

    "<h2>Project Goal and Process</h2><br>\n",
    "Through deeply analyzing and exploring the data I have collected, I will methodically pursue my project goal by answering the following sub-questions:<br><blockquote>\n",
    "1. How has the acquisition strategy change in each company over the past few decades? How is this reflected in the performance (stock prices) of each company?<br>\n",
    "2. When grouping the 7 Big-Tech companies according to the sector of industry that belong to (ex. Facebook & Twitter - Social Media, Google & Yahoo - Search Engine, etc.), how does the acquisition strategy differ across each group?<br>\n",
    "3. Is larger investment in company acquisitions correlated to greater success in business (increase in stock prices?)<br>\n",
    "4. Are there key acquisitions that pinpoint that lead the stock prices to increase or decrease heavily? <br>\n",
    "5. Are there notable derived products from the acquired companies that has led to an increase in stock prices?<br>\n",
