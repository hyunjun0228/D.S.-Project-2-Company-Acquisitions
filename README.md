# D.S.project-2-Company-Acquisitions
Analysis on M&amp;A of Big Tech Companies and Its Implications

The dataset 'acquisitions.csv' shows the top 7 big tech enterprises' acquisitions of start-ups and emerging companies ranging from as early as 1987 to 2018. Although the most recent update in this dataset is about 3 years, not only can this dataset provide us with an insight into how each company's business strategy has changed over time, but can also illustrate each company's outlook on future business strategies. Along with the 'acquisitions.csv' dataset, I will be using 'stock_info.csv' and 'sales_revenue.csv' dataset, which I have collected myself through the method of web scrpaing. 

Throughout the project, I will be answer the following questions:
1. What were some industries the top-companies have looked into the past few years and what are some industries that these companies today look into in order to broaden their business model for the future?
2. How has certain huge acquisitions made an impact on the company's stock (and how has it changed over time)?
3. How does the revenue and sales relates to the acquisition?
4. How does the acquisition of new companies correspond to the business strategies employed by those companies?
5. What are some key components that demonstrate the success of the acquisition (success rate of each company's acquisition)?
