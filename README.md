# D.S.project-2-Company-Acquisitions
Analysis on M&amp;A of Big Tech Companies and Its Implications

The dataset 'acquisitions.csv' shows the top 7 big tech enterprises' acquisitions of start-ups and emerging companies ranging from as early as 1987 to 2018. Although the most recent update in this dataset is about 3 years ago, not only can it provide us with an insight into how each company's business strategy has changed over time, but can also illustrate each company's outlook on future business strategies. Along with the 'acquisitions.csv' dataset, I will be using 'stock_info.csv' and 'sales_revenue.csv' dataset, which I have collected myself through the method of web scrpaing. 

Throughout the project, I will be answering the following questions:
1. How is the number of acquisitions and the company's stock prices related?
2. Does there exist a significant difference in yearly average number of acquisitions between each company?
3. Which industries does each company seek to expand their business in through acquisitions?
